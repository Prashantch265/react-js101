# React Props

Props stand for **"Properties."** They are **read-only** components. It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag. It gives a way to pass data from one component to other components. It is similar to function arguments. Props are passed to the component in the same way as arguments passed in a function.

Props are **immutable** so we cannot modify the props from inside the component. Inside the components, we can add attributes called props. These attributes are available in the component as this.props .

## State and Props

It is possible to combine both state and props. We can set the state in the parent component and pass it in the child component using props.

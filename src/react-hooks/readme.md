# React Hooks
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

## Rules of Hooks
- Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks.)
